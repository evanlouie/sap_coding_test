SAP Jam Collaboration Team Coding Pre-screen Questions
------------------------------------------------------

Many thanks for applying to join the SAP Jam Collaboration team!

There are two simple programming questions we ask to ensure that applicants who look
great on paper are also backed by technical prowess.

Please complete both questions:

1)  ./Ruby:
    - Write a simple Ruby program

2)  ./JS:
    - This folder contains a two-part Javascript jQuery + backbone + underscore question


Good luck!

## Solution

### Ruby
- To run, execute: `ruby hi_there.rb <INSERT NAME>`
  - example: `ruby hi_there.rb Evan Louie`
- Requires ruby standard library and makes use of the ruby Set and Time classes.

### Javascript
1.
  - Changed the ListView render to output `<button>` instead of `<span>`
  - Changed hook/callback/event to monitor `click button.delete` instead of `click span.delete`
2.
  - When clicking on 'Add list item', JS prompt will popup prompting for for first name.
  - Added an "Allow multiple first names" checkbox for if is necessary to allow for a first name to include multiple names (ex: Sarah Michelle Gellar).
  - Empty strings and null are not accepted as input for the list; such inputs will not be added.
