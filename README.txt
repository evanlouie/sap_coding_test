SAP Jam Collaboration Team Coding Pre-screen Questions
------------------------------------------------------

Many thanks for applying to join the SAP Jam Collaboration team!

There are two simple programming questions we ask to ensure that applicants who look 
great on paper are also backed by technical prowess.

Please complete both questions:

1)  ./Ruby: 
    - Write a simple Ruby program

2)  ./JS: 
    - This folder contains a two-part Javascript jQuery + backbone + underscore question


Good luck!

The SAP Jam Collaboration team
